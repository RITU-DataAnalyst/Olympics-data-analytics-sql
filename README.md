## 📌 Overview

This project is a **SQL-based case study** on Olympic Games data. Using PostgreSQL, I designed tables, cleaned raw datasets, and performed analytical queries to uncover insights about athletes, countries, sports, and medal trends.
The project demonstrates **data cleaning, data validation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL**
