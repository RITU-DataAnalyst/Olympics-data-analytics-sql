-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 1 : Total Row Count in Both Tables
-- Desc : To verify that the data was imported successfully.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Count(*) 
from noc_regions nr 


-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 2 : DISTINCT Count of Athletes, Events and countries, sports, year
-- Desc : This query will calculate the number of unique athletes, 
--        countries, sporting events, sports, and olympic years represented
--        in the dataset.
--        This helps understand the dataset's diversity.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	 Count(distinct sport) as total_sports,
	 Count(distinct year) as olympic_year_count
from athlete_events ae 


-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 3 : NULL counts in key columns
-- Desc   : This query will count the NULL value in age, height and 
--          weight columns that helps to identify the data quality issues. 
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 4 : Duplicate records for the same player,event,medal
-- Desc   : This query will check-is there any player who appear in 
--          the same event in the same year twice(rarest of the rare)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Desc   : Check How many male or female athletes participated in Olympics each year       
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 5 : Age,Height and weight Distribution Statistics
-- Desc   : Calculate the minimum, maximum, and average age, weight and height 
--          of athletes to identify any out of range or weird values.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

where age is not null and height is not null and weight is not null 


-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 6 : Check all noc codes
-- Desc   : Country Codes in athlete_events table that donâ€™t exist 
--          in noc_regions table (should be 0)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
